            <h3>Who can I get a Zaka loan?</h3>
            <p>Zaka connects investors to investment ready entrepreneurs. Zaka therefore identifies, prepares for investment and profiles into Zaka.co.ke financially excluded entrepreneurs who can’t access growth capital and affordable sources of credit due to
              various barriers in the formal financial system. Zaka team and partners (incubators and accelerators) conduct a thorough due diligence followed by investment preparation program to build their capacity. At Zaka, we are sector-agnostic therefore
              entrepreneurs from all sectors can borrow through Zaka platform.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="s-project-details">
            <h3>How does Zaka determine the interest rates on loans?</h3>
            <p>Zaka does not dictate interest rates to entrepreneurs or investors, all Zaka does is provide an indicative rate based on the entrepreneurs risk profile. The investors is then at liberty to make an offer to the entrepreneur. The entrepreneurs can
              either a) accept, b) reject, or c) negotiate. This way a fair interest acceptable to both the lender and borrow is charged.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="s-project-details">
            <h3>Can a Zaka investor offer a loan at 0% interest?</h3>
            <p>Yes, social investors and philanthropic lenders keen to support say, a women group can offer a loan at zero % interest. In this case, the investor only makes a 2.5% fee to support the operations of zaka platform and meet additional costs of
              including training, financial literacy classes and clients’ mobilization.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="s-project-details">
            <h3>Can I be both a lender (Investor) and a borrower (entrepreneur)?</h3>
            <p>Yes, you can register into the Zaka platform as an investor and a borrower. You however cannot borrow and lend at the same time, you can either borrow or invest at any one given time.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="s-project-details">
            <h3>As an investor in Zaka, do I need to fund the entire loan?</h3>
            <p>No, Zaka allows for syndicated loans using a crowdfunding approach. There are many individual lenders who come together to contribute towards a posted loan.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="s-project-details">
            <h3>Am I guaranteed that I get 100% repaid?</h3>
            <p>Zaka conducts a thorough due diligence on all the entrepreneurs posted on the website. The spirit of Zaka is to overcome the barriers that have existed barring credible entrepreneurs from accessing growth capital, key among them being
              security/collateral – we therefore drive a trust-based approach. Zaka therefore does not guarantee repayment for any loans crowdfunded on the Zaka website. Past borrowing history does not always guarantee future repayment, and Zaka investors should
              bare this in mind while making loans that could lead to losing some or all of the lender’s principal</p>

          <div class="s-project-details">
            <h3>Why should I pay Zaka registration fees and that too before getting the loan?</h3>

            <h3>What is the due diligence process on Zaka loans?</h3>
            <p>Entrepreneurs profiled on Zaka Platform are identified and vetted by either a Zaka Partner (Accelerator or Incubator) or Zaka Investment preparation team. For the partners, Zaka conducts a due diligence on the Enterprise support provider,
              Accelerator and/or Incubators.</p>
            Zaka Team conduct due diligence by following the following steps:
            <li>a) Conduct know-your-customer process,</li>
            <li>
              b) Entrepreneur selection criteria – Entrepreneur of high integrity, with good, long-term growth prospects,
            </li>

            </li>
            <li>f) Graduation and registration into Zaka Website. With this, Entrepreneurs can be connected to the Zaka network of investors. What happens if a loan doesn’t get fully funded on the Zaka Platform? Loans are posted into Zaka platform for a period
              of 30 days, after which they are put in the back for an additional 15 days. If the loans are not fully funded, then they are passed over to Zaka Straight loans for further review and possible top-up. There are possible cases where entrepreneurs won’t
              receive their loan even after profiling the same on Zaka website. When this happens, the investors who will have committed funds will get the same reimbursed. These should be rare cases and Zaka will do absolute best to ensure such cases are
              completely minimized. How do loan repayments get back to the Zaka investors? Loans are repaid from the entrepreneurs to the Zaka Investors through the Zaka payment gateway supported by Nouveta. Entrepreneurs use Zaka Payment platform to remit
              repayments and Zaka directs repaid loans into the investors wallet account. Once repaid, the investor can withdraw for different use, lend to another entrepreneur or donate to Zaka’s entrepreneurs support program.

              <h3>What does it cost the Investor to access the Zaka portal?</h3>

              <h3>What happens if an entrepreneur can’t repay the loan for one reason or another?</h3>
              <p>Now this is a real possibility in credit. In the even that an entrepreneur fall behind in loan payment, then Zaka will schedule to meet the entrepreneur and understand the circumstances and make a decision that safe-guards the investors funds. The
                loan may be re-scheduled to allow the entrepreneur re-organize their cash-flows.</p>
              <p>It is important to point out here that Zaka model is trust based and works to support the entrepreneur with Patient capital, so loan reschedule allows for this objective to be met. This is common practice in credit business.</p>
              <p>We also want to point out that sometimes, even with these efforts to recover, there may be cases where the entrepreneur simply can’t repay and the loan become delinquent. When this happens, Zaka will notify all contributing investors by email and
                schedule a meeting with the defaulter on the way forward. Zaka, Entrepreneur and Investors will then come out with a win-win approach on the way forward.</p>
